This is an analysis I did in R to determine if the price of a Big Mac in the US was a good precursor to valuations of the New York Exchange.

I took into account forecasts from the World Bank as well as the running value from the New York Exchange. Comparing them to the historical price of a Big Mac.

After this analysis, I then compared the forecast of the World Bank to the linear regression forecast of the Big Mac.

My findings were that the Big Mac price was a reflection of the economic health of the country, and not a precursor.
