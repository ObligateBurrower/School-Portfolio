# Portfolio
This is a repository of all the final projects from my Master's program.

I will continue to add to this as the program continues and I develop as a programmer/data scientist.

Here's a [model](DSC550_Term Project_jMadsen.pdf) I built to determine the likelihood someone would take out a second bank loan.

Here's an [analysis](Big_Mac_Index_Analysis.Rmd) on US market trends vs the price of a Big Mac.

I developed a fairly basic [Ethereum price forecast tool](Ethereum Forecast White Paper.pdf) using FB Prophet.

Here's an [analysis on how trade volume impacts the price of the US Stock Exchange](NYA_Statistics_Analysis.Rmd).

I did some [modeling on house market prices](Housing_Market_Data_Preparation.md) to see what factors of a home affect the price the most.

I built a [loot generator](DSC680_Proj2-jMadsen.pdf) for the game, Old School Runescape in preparation for a future project of mine.

Here is a model to predict [song popularity](Spotify_Popularity_Modelling.md) on Spotify based on several factors from the platform.

I created a [text based app to get current and forecast weather conditions](open_weather.md) for a location.
